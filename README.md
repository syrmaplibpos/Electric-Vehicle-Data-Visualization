# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Visualization

1. Background
The EV industry is being supported by governments throughout the world through subsidies and regulations, and consumers are demanding low-emission commuting over the fossil fuel-powered vehicles that are destroying the environment. Tesla has been one of the most successful EV companies/brands in the world, but others have also introduced EVs that are in demand from customers in many areas, including Mercedes Benz, BMW, Ford, Audi, Hyundai, Honda, and Nissan. There is no doubt that EVs are the future of transportation and driving.

2. Data Sources
Datasets are collected from data.wa.gov. Specifically, Electric Vehicle Title and Registration Activity dataset is used to explore the features that would impact the electric vehicles market in the state of Washington. In addition, data of the EV charging station in the State of Washington is downloaded from energy.gov. This data set contains the location, coordinate and category etc. of each charging station in Washington.

3. Goal
The project aims to better understand the electric vehicles market for both consumers and manufacturers by offering comprehensive insights through visualizations and analysis. Analyze current charging network, provide advise on future improvements.
